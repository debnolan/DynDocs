<h1>What does the Data really say? SAT and Teacher Salaries</h1>
<h2>---An Interactive Document on Confounding Variables and Simpson's Paradox </h2>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Education is a key component in public policy. As funds for public schools dwindle due to increasing budget restrictions, the debate revolves around both the share of education’s budget and the most efficient allocation of these funds from the public purse. In the following case, we can see how an immature knowledge of statistics can lead to potentially disastrous public policy results and how a fuller understanding of these problems can better delineate the true story and better affect the lives of people. </p>
	
<p>In the article “Meaningless Money Factor” (1993), George F. Will, a Pulizter Prize winning political essayist, points to case studies where some states with the lowest expenditure per student had the highest SAT scores and vice versa--the SAT test is a national college entrance examination used to indicate the academic preparation level for American high school students. He notes that this is a general trend and that the evidence shows that there is a negative correlation between teacher salaries and SAT scores. He concludes with his lament: “The fact that the quality of schools… [fails to correlate positively] with education appropriations will have no effect on the teacher unions’ insistence that money is the crucial variable.” He then concludes with "The public education lobby's crumbling last line of defense is the miseducation of the public."</p> 
	
<p>This evidence is somewhat counterintuitive to the idea that paying school teachers more will result in better grades as a result of improved quality of instruction and teaching talent. However, as we will see, the negative correlation does in fact exist! Does this mean that we should reduce public high school teachers’ salaries in order to better improve the academic futures of their students? In this document, we will examine the relationship between teachers’ salary and academic performance using SAT scores and introduce the idea of confounding variables.</p>

<h2>Data</h2>
<p>The data is from the paper “Getting What You Pay For: The Debate Over Equity in Public School Expenditures” by Deborah Lynn Guber (1999) from the Journal of Statistics Education.</p>

<p>There are a number of variables listed in the data description collected from 1994-1995 from public elementary and secondary schools:</p>

<p> State -- Name of state<br>
Region (region)--Which area the state belongs to in the United States<br>
Population--The number of people in that state<br>
Expenditure (expend) -- Current expenditure per pupil (in thousands of U.S. dollars per average daily attendance in public and elementary and secondary schools) <br>
Student Teacher Ratio (ratio) -- Average pupil to teacher ratio in public elementary and secondary schools during Fall 1994<br>
Teacher Salary (salary)-- Estimated average annual salary of teachers in public elementary and secondary schools during 1994-1995 (in thousands of US dollars)<br>
Eligible Student Fraction (frac) -- Percentage of all eligible students taking the SAT in 1994-1995<br> 
SAT Verbal (verbal) -- Average verbal SAT score in 1994-1995<br>   
SAT Math (math) --  Average math SAT score in 1994-1995<br>  
SAT Total Score (sat) -- Average total score on the SAT in 1994-1995<br>
</p>

<p>Just a glance at the data:</p> 
<div class="container-fluid">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-12">
      <div id="mytable1" class="shiny-html-output" style="overflow:scroll; height:400px;"></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div> 


<p>As we can see, there are 50 observation points representing each state with the given data recorded.</p>

<h2>Data Analysis</h2>

<h3>Correlation and Causation</h3>

<p>Correlation is the relationship between two different variables. When two variables are positively correlated, they have a positive association with each other; that is, when there is more of one variable, there is more of the other. For example, there might be more hot chocolate sales during colder weather and more iced tea sales during hot weather. When two things are negatively correlated with each other, they will have a negative association with each other. For example, when people have more money, they might be less inclined to purchase off-brand goods (such examples are known as "inferior goods" in Economics).</p> 

<p>It is important to note that correlation does not equal causation. That is, just because two variables move together well does not mean that one causes the other variable to increase. For example, if an epidemic spreads in certain parts of the world, higher numbers of doctors in those places with high incidences of a disease does not mean that the doctors caused the disease. Rather, doctors might have been sent to those places to address it.</p>

<p>When using an explanatory variable(i.e. the independent variable), which is the variable that we consider that might affect the variable of interest, we need to make sure that the explanatory variable is not really just showing the effect of another variable. Often, explanatory variables will have a number of other variables that are correlated with them, which can skew the explanatory power of the observations.</p>

<p>Here, we see a negative correlation between SAT scores and teacher salary:</p>

<p>However, there is a better way to observe variables. We have the technology:</p>

<p>In the charts above, you are able to compare the different relationships between SAT scores (with the options between “Verbal”, “Math”, and “Total” SAT scores) and the variables “Expenditure Per Pupil”, “Student-Teacher Ratio”, “Teacher Salary”, and “Eligible Fraction”. In addition, if you put your cursor over each individual point, you can see the corresponding values of the variables listed (Where the meaning of each is listed above in the "Data" section). Thus, with these two side-by-side plots, we are able to see which states tend to differ in certain aspects and of general trends with each region. Notice how the data for teacher salary and SAT scores varies greatly with a somewhat weaker negative overall correlation and how frac and SAT scores tend to be very strongly negatively correlated. Discover for yourself each variable's relationship with SAT scores and whether the nature of each relationship changes with different regions and other characteristics! Does the overall relationship differ from certain intervals of the data? Are there certain regions with noticeable relationships?</p>
<p>From the data, we can see that there indeed is a negative correlation between expenditures and SAT scores. However, in this analysis, we should not use expenditures because these negative correlations might be due to other factors not related to teacher salaries, such as inefficient or irrelevant allocations of funds (e.g. large investments into a new football stadium) or corruption (e.g. mysterious deposits into a Swiss bank account).</p>
<p>Thus, we use teacher salaries as our explanatory variable.</p>


<h3>Confounding Variables</h3>

<p>When an explanatory variable captures the effects of other unmentioned, or "hidden", variables, there is an issue called the "Omitted Variable Bias" that means that the correlation in the data may not show the true relationship between the explanatory and dependent variables.</p>

<p>Does the negative correlation between teacher salary and  SAT scores really reflect the effects of a different variable? Perhaps. To better illustrate this, we use this interactive 3-D plot:</p>

<p>We can see that there is strong positive correlation between frac, the fraction of students taking the SAT, and teacher salary and a very strong negative correlation between frac and SAT scores. Perhaps the issue is that the SAT is not required for all students. Thus, the issue in just viewing the relationship between SAT scores and teacher salary is that it reflects the effects of frac. </p>

<p>Why might this be? </p>

<div class="chunk" id="unnamed-chunk-3"><div class="rimage default"><img src="figure/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-3" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-3" class="plot" /></div></div>
<p>We note that states with the lowest fraction of students taking the SAT generally have the highest average scores. This might be due to selection bias--the students who actually take the SAT in places with low SAT participation rates tend to be prepared. In contrast, if the majority of students are expected to take the SAT in certain states, then students who are average are likely to take the tests. Thus, the average SAT score reflects this variable.</p>

<p>We note that states with the lowest fraction of students taking the SAT generally have the highest average scores.

In contrast, if the majority of students are expected to take the SAT in certain states, then students who are average are likely to take the tests. Thus, the average SAT score reflects this variable.</p>

<p>The key to observing the effects of teacher salary on SAT scores without the effects of frac is to hold constant, or control for, the frac variable. We do this by subsetting the data into various subsets of frac and observing the relationship between SAT and teacher salary for each group. Interestingly, we note that there is almost a perfect split in the data around the frac value of 40%.</p> 

<div class="chunk" id="unnamed-chunk-4"><div class="rimage default"><img src="figure/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-4" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-4" class="plot" /></div></div>

<p>This interactive regression app helps you understand step by step how this change of relationship came about:</p>

<p>Here you can observe how the regression line, the line which shows the average relationship between two variables, changes with different portions of the data. In this case, we simply observe what happens to the average relationship between average teacher salary and SAT scores for different levels of fraction of students taking the SAT. The R code and corresponding statistical data for the regression is displayed at the bottom of each plot. The discussion and interpretation of these values will not be discussed here; the main goal is to see how drastically some relationships can change due to hidden variables that are correlated with them.</p>
<p>In the first plot “Simple regression” we observe the decidedly negative correlation that some were concerned about. The regression shows the average relationship between average teacher salary and SAT scores with all of the data points.</p>
<p>In the “Controlling for frac” page, we observe the different relationships for different groups of fraction. The groups of fraction are as follows: [[1]] the 15 states with the lowest fraction of students taking the SAT (colored in Blue), [[2]] the states ranked 20-30 for the lowest fraction of student taking the SAT (in Gold), and [[3]] the 15 states with the highest fraction of SAT (in Red). The regression line of each group corresponds to each data point.</p>

<p>After dividing the data into these chunks, we observe that the slopes of the regression lines flatten and, for two of these groups, even become positive!</p>

<p>Moreover, looking at the “First Half of Data” and the “Second Half of Data” pages, we can learn even more regarding the groups. Notice how the two halves almost perfectly split around the 950  SAT score level.</p>

<p>This illustrates Simpson’s Paradox. </p>

<p>After partitioning the frac into two groups shown above, we note that correlation within each group differs from that of the overall negative correlation we previously observed. The group of states that have lower than 40 percent fraction of eligible students show a less steep negative correlation between salary and sat scores, white states that have higher than 40 percent fraction of eligible students show a positive correlation between salary and sat scores, the reverse of the overal correlation.</p>

<p>This phenomenon of changing correlation signs when data is partitioned into groups is known as Simpson’s Paradox. This paradox occurs when the trends between two variables become neutral or reverses when other variables are introduced.</p>

<h2>Simpson's Paradox Interactive Tutorial</p>
<h3>Kidney stone treatment example</h3>
<p>This example is taken from wikipedia.</p>
<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_paradox" style="font-size:11px">
	<p>This is a real-life example from a medical study[12] comparing the success rates of two treatments for kidney stones.[13]</p>


<p>The table below shows the success rates and numbers of treatments for treatments involving both small and large kidney stones, where Treatment A includes all open surgical procedures and Treatment B is percutaneous nephrolithotomy (which involves only a small puncture). The numbers in parentheses indicate the number of success cases over the total size of the group. (For example, 93% equals 81 divided by 87.)</p>

<p>
The paradoxical conclusion is that treatment A is more effective when used on small stones, and also when used on large stones, yet treatment B is more effective when considering both sizes at the same time. In this example the "lurking" variable (or confounding variable) of the stone size was not previously known to be important until its effects were included.</p>


<p>Which treatment is considered better is determined by an inequality between two ratios (successes/total). The reversal of the inequality between the ratios, which creates Simpson's paradox, happens because two effects occur together:</p>


<ol>
	<li>The sizes of the groups, which are combined when the lurking variable is ignored, are very different. Doctors tend to give the severe cases (large stones) the better treatment (A), and the milder cases (small stones) the inferior treatment (B). Therefore, the totals are dominated by groups 3 and 2, and not by the two much smaller groups 1 and 4.</li>
	<li>The lurking variable has a large effect on the ratios, i.e. the success rate is more strongly influenced by the severity of the case than by the choice of treatment. Therefore, the group of patients with large stones using treatment A (group 3) does worse than the group with small stones, even if the latter used the inferior treatment B (group 2).</li>
</ol>
<p>Based on these effects, the paradoxical result is seen to arise by suppression of the causal effect of stone size on successful treatment. The paradoxical result can be rephrased more accurately as follows: When the less effective treatment (B) is applied more frequently to easier cases, it can appear to be a more effective treatment.</p>


</blockquote>
</p>

<p>Below is an interactive table that help you understand how Simpson's paradox work. </p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>Treatment A is the more effect treatment that doctors tend to give more to severe cases.</li>
<li>Treatment B is the less effect treatment that doctors tend to give more to milder cases.</li>
<li>What's fixed?</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Total number of cases being treated is fixed: 350 cases.</li>
    <li>The success rates of each treatment treating small stones and large stones are fixed.
      <ul>
    <li>Treatment A treat small stones with a success rate of 93 percent.</li>
    <li>Treatment A treat large stones with a success rate of 73 percent.</li> 
    <li>Treatment B treat small stones with a success rate of 87 percent.</li>
    <li>Treatment B treat small stones with a success rate of 69 percent.</li>
      </ul>

    <li>The marginal totals are not fixed</li>

<p>We have introduced the concepts of Omitted Variable Bias and Simpson's Paradox in the context of SAT scores and teacher salaries. We have shown that there are cases where an explanatory variable can actually reflect the effects of a different, perhaps unknown, variable, which may seriously compromise that variable's explanatory power. In our increasingly data driven world, people are often looking to data in order to make informed decisions; in order to make sense of this data, however, it is important to understand these concepts--especially regarding perplexing policy problems with significant effects on people. Therefore, we must be careful to understand what lies within the data.</p>
