Two ideas to improve:
  1) 7 drop down menu items. Subset the data by fraction and show each regression line for each subset. 
      a) Highlight the subset from the original plot--each a different color. 
  
  2) Checkbox for each subset. Each subset has a different color. 
      where you have the original data points. 
          Then you can choose which sets of data you can include. 
        Check each different box. Each box represents a different set. 
          Combine Regressions. 

  3) Optional: Slider for the data. Includes everything. 

3) Talk about Zoes plots and the correlations between each of the variables. 

4) Incorporate Zoes code for the Y variable...


Zoes plot

1) Maybe make the tiniest plot points bigger.
