<h2>An Introduction</h2>
	<p>Education is a key component in public policy. As funds for public schools dwindle due to increasing budget restrictions, the debate revolves around both the share of education’s budget and the most efficient allocation of these funds from the public purse. In the following case, we can see how an immature knowledge of statistics can lead to potentially disastrous public policy results and how a fuller understanding of these problems can best delineate the true story and best affect the lives of people. </p>
	<p>In a recent policy debate, _______ had argued that teachers should be paid less in order to best improve performance for public schools! The evidence he points to is a negative correlation between teacher salaries and SAT scores--the SAT test is a national college entrance examination used to indicate the academic preparation level for American high school students. </p>
	<p>
This evidence is somewhat counterintuitive to the idea that paying school teachers more will result in better grades as a result of improved quality of instruction and teaching talent. However, as we will see, the negative correlation does in fact exist! Does this mean that we should reduce public high school teachers&#39 salaries in order to best improve the academic futures of their students? In this document, we will examine the relationship between teachers’ salary and academic performance using SAT scores and introduce the idea of confounding variables. </p>
