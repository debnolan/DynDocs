### Question: which year is the data drawn from?
### variables: teacher salary(annual? average?); ratio(student-teacher ratio?); frac(eligible student?)
# produce a matrix of scatterplot
#### we can make a static matrix of scatterplot, maybe not necessary...
#### then we can make one correlation scatterplot that allow them to see the individual correlation,
#### and it would also show the corresponding numeric correlation coefficient.

#### For each scatterplot, independent variable x could be SAT overall, Math, Vor erbal; dependent variable
#### can be the rest of the variables (ratio, expend, frac, salary)

## # aslo we can make the scatterplot circle proportional to the state population...
## # also include a pointer that tells which state the point is...

pairs( satDF[ , c("expend","ratio","salary","frac", "sat")] )
# find correlations 
cor( satDF[ , c("expend","ratio","salary","frac", "sat")] )
# expenditures are negatively correlated with SAT
# Four states increase the size, New Jersy, New York, Alaska, Connecticut.
order(satDF$expend, decreasing = T) 
# The fraction of eligible students has the strongest correlation with SAT, 
# and they are negatively correlated.
# Fraction of eligible students is highly positively correlated wtih expenditures
# and teacher

## 3-variable model
## Fit a 3-variable model of SAT on teacher salary, student-teacher ratio, and eligible fraction.
