	<h1>Hidden Markov Models</h1>

	<p>
		The idea of Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is developed based on Markove Model. HMM is used when the system being modeled is assumed to be a Markov process with
		unobserved (hidden) states.
	</p>

	<p>
		So, let us talk about simple Markov Model before HMM. 
	</p>

	<h2>Markov Chain</h2>

	<p>
		One typical example of Markov Model is Markov Chain. A Markov Chain is a random process that undergoes transitions from one state to another on a state space. It must possess a property that is usually characterized as "memoryless": the probability distribution of the next state depends only on the current state and not on the sequence of events that preceded it, which can be shown as:
	</p>

	<p>
		$$P(X_t|X_{t-1}, X_{t-2}... X_1) = P(X_t|X_{t-1})$$
	</p>

	<p>
		A Markov Chain can be graphically represented as:
	</p>

	<p>
		Where $X_1$, $X_2$, $X_3$... are called the <b>state</b>.
	</p>

	<p>
		It has the following parameters:
	</p>

	<p>
		<LI><b>Initial distribution</b>: $P(X_1)$
	</p>

	<p>
		<LI><b>Transition probabilities</b>: $P(X_t|X_{t-1})$
	</p>

	<h3>Real Life Markov Chain Example: Weather</h3>

	<p>
		Build a model that each day's weather is depended on the previous day's weather. Also, in order to simlify the problem, we assume there are only two types of weather: sun and rain. In this way, the initial distribution is the first day's weather, and the transition probabilities is the relation between 2 consecutive days' weather.
	</p>

	<p>
		The problem can be visulized by setting different parameters and the number of steps (days):
