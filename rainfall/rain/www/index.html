<h1>Extreme Value Distributions</h1>
<hr />
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p> The classical asymptotically model for excesses above a high
threshold is the generalised Pareto distribution. It is often useful to look 
at the exceedances over a given threshold instead of the maximum or minimum of the data.
However, selection of a threshold that is too low will give biased parameter estimates,
but a threshold that is too high will result in large variance of the parameter estimates.
Specifically, we will look at the probability plot, quantile plot, return level plot, and density
plot which involves the fitting of data to a GPD several times using a range of
different thresholds and estimate its return values.  </p>
