  <h1>Extreme Value Distributions</h1>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  
  <p> In this project, we will look at the probability plot, quantile plot, return
  level plot, and density plot which involves the fitting of data to a Generalized Pareto Distribution using a range of different thresholds and estimate its return values of a weather station in Colarado. 
  </p>

  <h2>Asymptootic Model Characterization</h2>
  <p> The classical asymptotically model for excesses above a high
  threshold is the generalised Pareto distribution. It is often useful to look 
  at the exceedances over a given threshold instead of the maximum or minimum of the data.
  </p>

  <h2>The Generalized Pareto Distribution </h2>
  <p> 
  Suppose X<SUB><FONT size=-1>1</font></sub>,X<SUB><FONT size=-1>2</font></sub>,... be a sequence of i.i.d. random variables with distribution function, <I>F</i>, and let M<SUB><FONT size=-1>n</font></sub> =
  <TT>max</tt>{X<SUB><FONT size=-1>1</font></sub>,...,X<SUB><FONT size=-1>n</font></sub>}. Now,
  assuming that <I>F</i> satisfies certain conditions, then we have that Pr{M<SUB><FONT size=-1>n</font></sub> &le; z} &asymp; G(z), where

  <p> 
  for some &mu;, &sigma; &gt; 0 and &xi;.  Then for a large enough threshold, u, the distribution function of GPD (X-&mu;), conditional on X &gt; u, is then given by
  </p>
  
  <img src="GPDdefinition.png"></a>
  
  <p>
    where $z={\frac{(x-&mu;)}{&sigma;}}$, and k, &sigma;, &mu; are the shape, scale, and location parameters respectively. The scale of &sigma; must be positive, the shape and location can take any real numbers.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The shape parameter &xi; is important to determine the tail distribution of the GPD:
  </p>
  
  <p>&bull; &xi; &lt; 0: short tail with finite upper end point of $u - \frac{&sigma;_u}{&xi;}$ </p>
  <p>&bull; &xi; = 0: exponential tail</p>
  <p>&bull; &xi; &gt; 0: heavy tail</p>
  
  <h2>Outline Justification for the Generalized Pareto Model</h2>
  <p>
   In this section, we will look at a proof of how GEV and GPD models are related one or another. Let X follows GEV distribution over a high threshold u and y is the excess (x-&mu;).     
  </p>
  <p>
    $$Pr\{X > u + y | X > u\} = {\frac{1-Pr(X < x + u)}{1-Pr(X < u)}}$$
    $$ = {\frac{[1 + \frac{&xi;(u + y - &mu;)}{&sigma;}]^{\frac{-1}{&xi;}}}{[1 + \frac{&xi;(u - &mu;)}{&sigma;}]^{\frac{-1}{&xi;}}}}  $$
    
    $$ = [1 + {\frac{\frac{&xi;(u + y - &mu;)}{&sigma;}}{1+\frac{&xi;(u - &mu;)}{&sigma;}}}]^{\frac{-1}{&xi;}} $$
    $$ = [1 + {\frac{&xi; y }{&sigma;}}]^{\frac{-1}{&xi;}} $$
  </p>
  <p>
    where &sigma;<SUB><FONT size=-1>u</font></sub> = &sigma; + &xi; (u-&mu;).&sigma;<SUB><FONT size=-1>u</font></sub> is the scale parameter of the Generalizd Pareto model and &sigma; is the scale of the point process model. This derivation makes the dependence of the GPD scale &sigma;<SUB><FONT size=-1>u</font></sub> and threshold u very clear that the GPD shape parameter is the same as the Generalized Extreme Value(GEV) shape parameter.
  </p>
  
      <h3>Threshold Selection</h3>
  <p>
  Selection of a threshold that is too low will result biased parameter estimates, but a threshold that is too high will result in large variance of the parameter estimates. The idea of selecting a reasonable approximation is to pick a low threshold for the limit subject model. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Suppose a raw data consist of a sequence of i.i.d. measurements x<SUB><FONT size=-1>1</font></sub>,x<SUB><FONT size=-1>2</font></sub>...,x<SUB><FONT size=-1>n</font></sub> and let x<SUB><FONT size=-1>(-1)</font></sub>,x<SUB><FONT size=-1>(-2)</font></sub>...,x<SUB><FONT size=-1>(k)</font></sub> represent the subset of data points that exceed a particular threshold u and X<SUB><FONT size=-1>max</font></sub> is the largest of X<SUB><FONT size=-1>i</font></sub>. Define threshold excesses by y<SUB><FONT size=-1>j</font></sub> = x<SUB><FONT size=-1>(j)</font></sub>-u for j = 1,...,k. This lead to the following procedure.
  </p> 
  <p> 
    ${(u,${\frac{1}{n_u}}\sum_{i=1}^{n_u} (x_(i) - u)): u < x_max}$
  </p>
  <p>
    The devivation is termed as the mean residual life plot where where x<SUB><FONT size=-1>(-1)</font></sub> is the observation above the u and n<SUB><FONT size=-1>u</font></sub> is the number of observation above the u. This method can potentially provide a way of choosing an appropriate threshold. As u increases, the mean residual plot changes linearly with u.
  </p>
  
      <h3>Parameter Estimation </h3>
      <p>
        Having determined a threshold, the parameters of the generalized Pareto distribution can be estimated by maximum likelihood. Maximum likelihood estimation of the parameters (k, &alpha;) was considered by DuMouchel (1983), Davison (1984), R. L. Smith (1984, 1987), J. A. Smith (1986), and Joe (1987). To compute the GPD maximum likelihood estimates, there are two values of (k, &alpha;) that must be investigated, such that $\Re = \{k < 0, &alpha; > 0\} \cup \{0 < k \leq 1, {\frac{&alpha;}{k}} > X_n\}$. The first is the local maximum of the loglikelihood in space $\Re$ and the second is at the boundary space $\Re$, where k = 1. Suppose that X = {X<SUB><FONT size=-1>1</font></sub>,X<SUB><FONT size=-1>2</font></sub> . . , X<SUB><FONT size=-1>n</font></sub>} is a random sample from the GPD with largest value of X<SUB><FONT size=-1>n</font></sub>. Then, the loglikelihood
is given by 
      </p>
      <p>
        $$l(&sigma;, &xi;) = klog&sigma; - (1 + {\frac{1}{&sigma;}})\sum_{i=1}^{k} log(1+{\frac{&xi;y_i}{&sigma;}}),  k \neq 0$$
      </p>
      <p> $$l(&sigma;, &xi;) = -klog&sigma; - {\frac{1}{&sigma;}}\sum_{i=1}^{k} y_i,  k = 0$$ </p>
      
      <p>
      where &sigma; > 0 for k > 0 and &sigma; > kX<SUB><FONT size=-1>(n)</font></sub> for k > 0. If k > 1, then there is no maximum likelihood estimate because $\lim_{{\frac{&alpha;}{k}}\to X^{+}} L(k, &alpha;; X) = \infty$ 
      </p>
      <h3>Return Levels</h3>
      <p>
        When measuring the extreme value models, it is more convenient to interpret them in terms of return levels or quantiles rather than individual parameter values. Return levels are best to measure on the annual scale, so that the N-year return level is the level that is expected to be exceeded once in every N years. Suppose that a generalized Pareto distribution with parameters &sigma; and &xi; is a suitable model for exceedances of a threshold u by a variable X, such that
      </p>
      <p> $$Pr(X > x | X > u) = [1+&xi;({\frac{x-u}{&sigma;}})]^{\frac{-1}{&xi;}}$$</p>
      <p> $$Pr(X > x) = &xi;_u[1 + &xi;({\frac{x_m-u}{&sigma;}})]^{\frac{-1}{&xi;}} = {\frac{1}{m}}$$ </p>
      <p> where x<SUB><FONT size=-1>m</font></sub> is the m observation return level which it exceeds the average on every m observations and &xi; $\neq$ 0 
      </p>

  <h3>Application of Generalized Pareto model</h3>
  <p> 
  In our present work, we first pick a weather station in Colorado and calculate maximum precipitation and the number of heavy rainfall events. For example, the first plot is the disribution plot of the first weather station's daily percipitation ranging from 1948 to 2001 with an extremal threshold u(red line). The selection of the value of the threshold u is crucial: setting u too high will result high variance of the estimate of the parameters; setting u too small will result a larger number of data exceed the threshold, and so the estimates of the parameters will have low variance and lead to bias because the non-extremal tail does not be well-fit by the GPD model. </p>
  <p>
  The interpretation of a mean residual life plot is not easy to estimate in practice; the second plot is the mean residual life plot with 95% confidence intervals from the daily rainfall data. The graph, particular in weather station 7, appears to curve from u = 0 to u ~ 100, beyond which is approximately linear until u ~ 300, where it decays sharply. It is tempting to conclude that there is no stability until u = 300 because it appears approximate linearity. The information from the plot for large values of u is unreliable due to the limited amount of data in which the estimate and confidence interval are based. Therefore, it is statistically significant to conclude there is some evidence for linearity above u = 100, and we should work initially with a threshold at U<SUB><FONT size=-1>0</font></sub> = 100.
</p>
  <p>From the fitted distribution, we can estimate how often the extreme quantiles occur with a certain return level. The return value is defined as a value that is expected to be equaled or exceeded on average in each time interval. We calculated return values for 2-, 5-, 10-, 20-yr, 100-yr and 200-yr return period at each grid point. Finally, we provide diagnostic plots for the fitted generalized Pareto model to explain threshold excess fitted to daily rainfall data of each weather station.
