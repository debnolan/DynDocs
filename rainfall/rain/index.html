  <h1>Extreme Value Distributions</h1>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  
  <p> In this project, we will look at the probability plot, quantile plot, return
  level plot, and density plot which involves the fitting of data to a GPD using a range of different thresholds and estimate its return values. 
  </p>

  <h2>Asymptootic Model Characterization</h2>
  <p> The classical asymptotically model for excesses above a high
  threshold is the generalised Pareto distribution. It is often useful to look 
  at the exceedances over a given threshold instead of the maximum or minimum of the data.
  </p>

  <h2>The Generalized Pareto Distribution </h2>
  <p> 
  Suppose X<SUB><FONT size=-1>1</font></sub>,X<SUB><FONT size=-1>2</font></sub>,... be a sequence of i.i.d. random variables with distribution function, <I>F</i>, and let M<SUB><FONT size=-1>n</font></sub> =
  <TT>max</tt>{X<SUB><FONT size=-1>1</font></sub>,...,X<SUB><FONT size=-1>n</font></sub>}. Now,
  assuming that <I>F</i> satisfies certain conditions, then we have that Pr{M<SUB><FONT size=-1>n</font></sub> &le; z} &asymp; G(z), where

  <p> 
  for some &mu;, &sigma; &gt; 0 and &xi;.  Then for a large enough threshold, u, the distribution function of GPD (X-&mu;), conditional on X &gt; u, is then given by

  <p>
    where z=(x-&mu;)/&sigma;, and k, &sigma;, &mu; are the shape, scale, and location parameters respectively. The scale of &sigma; must be positive, the shape and location can take any real numbers.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The shape parameter &xi; is important to determine the tail distribution of the GPD:
  </p>
  
  <p>&bull; &xi; &lt; 0: short tail with finite upper end point of $u - \frac{&sigma;_u}{&xi;}$ </p>
  <p>&bull; &xi; = 0: exponential tail</p>
  <p>&bull; &xi; &gt; 0: heavy tail</p>
  
  <h2>Outline Justification for the Generalized Pareto Model</h2>
      <h2>Modeling Threshold Excesses</h2>
      <h3>Threshold Selection</h3>
  <p>
  Selection of a threshold that is too low will result biased parameter estimates, but a threshold that is too high will result in large variance of the parameter estimates. The idea of selecting a reasonable approximation is to pick a low threshold for the limit subject model. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Suppose a raw data consist of a sequence of i.i.d. measurements x<SUB><FONT size=-1>1</font></sub>,x<SUB><FONT size=-1>2</font></sub>...,x<SUB><FONT size=-1>n</font></sub> and let x<SUB><FONT size=-1>(-1)</font></sub>,x<SUB><FONT size=-1>(-2)</font></sub>...,x<SUB><FONT size=-1>(k)</font></sub> represent the subset of data points that exceed a particular threshold u and X<SUB><FONT size=-1>max</font></sub> is the largest of X<SUB><FONT size=-1>i</font></sub>. Define threshold excesses by y<SUB><FONT size=-1>j</font></sub> = x<SUB><FONT size=-1>(j)</font></sub>-u for j = 1,...,k. This lead to the following procedure.
  </p> 
  <p> 
    ${(u,${\frac{1}{n_u}}\sum_{i=1}^{n_u} (x_(i) - u)): u < x_max}$
  </p>
  <p>
    It is termed as the mean residual life plot where the plot is approximately linear in threshold, u.
  </p>
  
      <h3>Parameter Estimation</h3>
      <h3>Return Levels</h3>

  
  <h3>Application of GEV distribution</h3>
  <p> Based on the extreme value theory that derives the GEV distribution, we can fit a sample of extremes to the GEV distribution to obtain the parameters that best explains the probability distribution of the extremes. In our present work, we first pick a weather station in Colorado and calculate daily maximum precipitation and the number of heavy rainfall events. These extremes-related quantities are, respectively, fitted to the GEV distribution. From the fitted distribution, we can estimate how often the extreme quantiles occur with a certain return level. The return value is defined as a value that is expected to be equaled or exceeded on average once every interval of time (T) (with a probability of 1/T). Therefore, we obtain the equation, CDF of the GEV distribution (i.e., equation (1)) = 1-1/T. We call "T" on the right hand side of this equation as a return period, and "x" in equation (1) (left hand side) is the return value. The return value can be calculated by solving this equation (i.e., by inverting the GEV distribution). In our current work, We calculated return values for 2-, 5-, 10-, and 20-yr return period at each grid point.
