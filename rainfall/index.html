  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>
  <em>Extreme value theory</em> is a separate branch of statistics that deals with extreme 
  events. This theory is based on the <em>extremal types theorem</em>, also called the <em>three types 
  theorem</em>, stating that there are only three types of distributions that are needed to model the 
  maximum or minimum of the collection of random observations from the same distribution.  three models - specifically, the Gumbell, Fr&eacute;chet, and Weibull distributions. Collectively, these three classes of distribution are termed as

  <h2>Gumbel Distribution</h2>

  <div style="float: left; margin-right: 15px; margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;">
  <img src="/img/art/gumbel_pic.gif" width="100" height="120" alt="Emil Gumbel" style='border: 1px solid black;'>  </div>
  
  <p>
  One of the first scientists to apply the theory was a German mathematician Emil Gumbel (1891-1966).
  Gumbel's focus was primarily on applications of extreme value theory to engineering problems, in 
  particular modeling of meteorological phenomena such as annual flood flows:
  </p>

  <p>
  The Gumbel distribution, also known as the <em>Extreme Value Type I</em> distribution, is unbounded 
  (defined on the entire real axis), and has the following probability density function:
  </p>

  <div><center><img src="/img/f/f_034.gif" width="233" height="40" alt="Gumbel Distribution PDF" ></center>&nbsp;</div>

  <p>
  where z=(x-&mumu;)/&sigma;, &mu; is the location parameter, and &sigma; is the distribution scale 
  (&sigma;&gt;0). The shape of the Gumbel model does not depend on the distribution parameters:

  <p>
  The graph above shows the Gumbel PDF for &sigma;=1 and &mu;=0.

  <h2>Fr&eacute;chet Distribution</h2>

  <div style="float: left; margin-right: 15px; margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;">

  <p>
  Maurice Fr&eacute;chet (1878-1973) was a French mathematician who had identified one possible 
  limit distribution for the largest order statistic in 1927. The Fr&eacute;chet distribution, 
  also known as the <em>Extreme Value Type II</em> distribution, is defined as
  </p>

  <div><center><img src="/img/f/f_126.gif" width="266" height="50" alt="Fr&eacute;chet Distribution PDF" ></center>&nbsp;</div>

  <p>
  where &alpha; is the shape parameter (&alpha;&gt;0), and &beta; is the scale parameter 
  (&beta;&gt;0). This distribution is bounded on the lower side (x&gt;0) and has a heavy upper 
  tail. The animation below shows the Fr&eacute;chet PDF graph for &beta;=1 and various 
  values of &alpha;:

  <h2>Weibull Distribution</h2>

  <div style="float: left; margin-right: 15px; margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;">
  <img src="/img/art/weibull_pic.gif" width="100" height="124" alt="Waloddi Weibull" style='border: 1px solid black;'>  </div>
  
  <p>
  Waloddi Weibull (1887-1979) was a Swedish engineer and scientist well-known for his work on 
  strength of materials and fatigue analysis. The Weibull distribution, also known as the 
  <em>Extreme Value Type III</em> distribution, first appeared in his papers in 1939. 
  The two-parameter version of this distribution has the density function
  </p>

  <div><center><img src="/img/f/f_099.gif" width="268" height="50" alt="Two-Parameter Weibull Distribution PDF" ></center>&nbsp;</div>

  <p>
  The Weibull distribution is defined for x&gt;0, and both distribution parameters (&alpha; - shape, 
  &beta; - scale) are positive. The two-parameter Weibull distribution can be generalized by adding 
  the location (shift) parameter &gamma;:
  </p>

  <div><center><img src="/img/f/f_011.gif" width="328" height="50" alt="Three-Parameter Weibull Distribution PDF" ></center>&nbsp;</div>

  <p>
  In this model, the location parameter &gamma; can take on any real value, and the distribution is 
  defined for x&gt;&gamma;. 
  </p>

  <p>
  Even though the Weibull distribution was originally developed to address the problems arising
  in material sciences, it is widely used in many other areas thanks to its flexibility.
  When &alpha;=1, this distribution reduces to the Exponential model, and when &alpha;=2, it
  mimics the Rayleigh distribution which is mainly used in telecommunications. In addition, it resembles 
  the Normal distribution when &alpha;=3.5:
  </p>

  <div><center><img src="/img/art/evd_5.gif" width="349" height="259" alt="Weibull Distribution PDF" ></center>&nbsp;</div>

  <p>
  It's worth noting that the Gumbel and Fr&eacute;chet models described above relate to maxima 
  (<em>largest</em> extreme value), while the Weibull model relates to minima (<em>smallest</em> 
  extreme value). This form of the Weibull distribution is commonly used in practice.

  <h2>Generalized Extreme Value Distribution</h2>

  <p>
  The Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution is a flexible three-parameter model that combines 
  the Gumbel, Fr&eacute;chet, and Weibull <em>maximum</em> extreme value distributions. It has the following PDF:
  <p>

  <div><center><img src="/img/f/f_076.gif" width="391" height="93" alt="GEV Distribution PDF" ></center>&nbsp;</div>

  <p>
  where z=(x-&mu;)/&sigma;, and k, &sigma;, &mu; are the shape, scale, and location parameters respectively. 
  The scale must be positive (<em>sigma</em>&gt;0), the shape and location can take on any real value. The 
  range of definition of the GEV distribution depends on k:
  <p>

  <div><center><img src="/img/f/f_080.gif" width="224" height="63" alt="GEV Distribution Domain" ></center>&nbsp;</div>

  <p>
  Various values of the shape parameter yield the extreme value type I, II, and III distributions. Specifically, 
  the three cases k=0, k&gt;0, and k&lt;0 correspond to the Gumbel, Fr&eacute;chet, and "reversed" Weibull 
  distributions. The reversed Weibull distribution is a quite rarely used model bounded on the upper side. 
  For example, for k=&minus;0.5, the GEV PDF graph has the form:
  </p>

  <div><center><img src="/img/art/evd_3.gif" width="349" height="259" alt="GEV Distribution PDF - The Reversed Weibull Case" ></center>&nbsp;</div>

  <p>
  When fitting the GEV distribution to sample data, the sign of the shape parameter k will usually 
  indicate which one of the three models best describes the random process you are dealing with.
