  <p>A clinical trial is run to assess the effectiveness of a new anti-retroviral therapy for patients with HIV. Patients are randomized to receive a standard anti-retroviral therapy (usual care) or the new anti-retroviral therapy and are monitored for 3 months. The primary outcome is viral load which represents the number of HIV copies per milliliter of blood. A total of 30 participants are randomized and the data are shown below. Note that we have converted the data to HIV copies per liter of blood.</p>
