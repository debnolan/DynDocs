<p>Many states are considering lowering the blood-alcohol level at which a driver is designated as driving under the influence (DUI) of alcohol. An investigator for a legislative committee designed the following test to study the effect of alcohol on reaction time. Ten participants consumed a specified amount of alcohol. Another group of ten participants consumed the same amount of a non-alcoholic drink, a placebo. The two groups did not know whether they were receiving alcohol or the placebo. The twenty participants' average reaction times (in seconds) to a series of simulated driving situations are reported in the following table.</p>
