<h4>Data Description</h4>
  <p>These data are from a drug trial testing whether calcium is effective in lowering blood pressure. 19 participants were randomly selected to receive one of two treatments. Before starting treatment, their blood pressure values were taken (mmHg). Then, 9 participants were given administered a set dose of calcium over a certain span of time, while the other 10 were given a placebo for the same time period. After the treatment was over, blood pressure values were again recorded. The table below shows the difference between the final and initial blood pressures for each participant. When we run our permutations test, we will select 9 values from the general population and will compare the means of the permutations to the mean of our calcium trial.</p>
