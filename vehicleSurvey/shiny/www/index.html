  <h1>Bootstrap Analysis</h1>
  <p>
  The Vehicle Inventory and Use Survey (VIUS) has been conducted by the U.S. government to provide information on the number of private and commercial trucks in each state. For the 2002 VIUS-CA survey, 5 strata were formed from the sampling frame of truck registrations using stratification variable trucktype.  The truck registrations were partitioned into one of five classes:
1. Pickups
2. Minivans, other light vans, and sport utility vehicles
3. Light single-unit trucks with gross vehicle weight less than 26,000 pounds
4. Heavy single-unit trucks with gross vehicle weight greater than or equal to 26,000 pounds
5. Truck-tractors
