 <h1>Traffic on I-80: Congestion and Line Comparison</h1> 
 <h1>Exploratory Data Analysis</h1>
 <h2>Intro</h2>
</div>
  
 <h3>PeMS</h3>
<p>
Performance Measurement System (PeMS): Real time and archived traffic
data displayed from over 25,000 individual detectors along the state
freeways. Includes traffic detectors, incidents, lane closures, toll
tags, census traffic counts, vehicle classification, weight-in-motion,
and roadway inventory data.
</p>
<p>
PeMS is a freeway performance measurement system for all of California.  It processes 2 GB/day of 30-second loop detector data in real time to produce useful information. Managers at any time can have a uniform, and comprehensive assessment of freeway performance. Traffic engineers can base their operational decisions on knowledge of the current state of the freeway network. Planners can determine whether congestion bottlenecks can be alleviated by improving operations or by minor capital improvements. Travelers can obtain the current shortest route and travel time estimates. Researchers can validate their theory and calibrate simulation models 
</p>
<p>
The PeMS system receives flow and occupancy from approximately 22,000
loops across the state every 30 seconds: 2 GB per day.
</p>

 <h3>Our data:</h3>
<p>
data collected by loop detectors at a particular location of eastbound
Interstate 80 in Sacramento, California, from March 14-20, 2003.For
each of three lanes, the flow (number of cars) and the occupancy (the
percentage of time there was a car over the loop) were recorded in
successive five minute intervals.  There were 1740 such five minute
intervals. Lane 1 is the leftmost lane, lane 2 is in the center, and
lane 3 is the rightmost.
</p>

<h3>Our goals</h3>
<p>
Want to look at the congestion and explore the difference between the
tree lanes of traffic.
</p>

<div class="header">
  <h2>Flow and Occupancy</h2>
</div>  

<p>
Look at the Flow and Occupancy time series: can you guess times of the
day? Days of the week? 
</p>

What is the relationship between $F$ (flow) and $O$ (occupancy)? 
</p>

<div id="plot2" class="shiny-plot-output" 
     style="width: 80%; height: 450px"></div>  

<p>
We can see that overall the relantionship is not linear, but there is
clearly a pattern. Cannot fit a regression line to the whole data but
can use local weighted polynomial smoother - loess (fit one line to
each of the lanes). Left part - most of the points, definitely linear,
assume it is a non-congested traffic. Makes sense since the ratio of $F$
and $O$ is a quantity directly  related to speed (want the plot in the center!).

    </label>
  </div>  

<div class="header">
  <h2>Speed, Distance, and Congestion</h2>
</div>  

<p>
If the length of the cars is the same for all the cars, $F/S$ is proportional to
the speed. For simplicity, let's make a few assumptions that will help
us formalize the relationships between the variables (will relax those
assumptions later) and make a clear definition of congestion:
</p>
<ol>
  <li> $l$ - length of the car (constant)</li>
  <li> All the cars follow a "two-second rule" or "$c$-second rule" ($c$
  might be different for each lane): a driver has to reach a point on
  the road at least c seconds after the car directly in front passed
  it. $c$ is a constant.</li>
  <li> If a car's speed is limited by the car in front of it, it keeps
  the minimal distance required by a "$c$-second rule"</li>
  <li> Speed is constant during each five-minute interval (can think
  of average speed).</li>
  <li> Distances between the cars are the same during each five-minute interval 
  (can think of average distance).</li>
  <li> All cars observe some speed limit $m$.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Some more useful notation:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>$V = \displaystyle{\frac{F}{O} \propto Speed}$ 
  (will call $V$ speed for short  )</li>
  <li>D - space between the cars (rear bumper to front bumper)</li>
  <li>E - extra space between the cars (in addition to the space
  required by a "$c$-second rule"</li>
</ul>
<p>
Then 
\[ O = \frac{l}{l + D} = \frac{l}{l + cV + E} = \frac{l - cF}{l + E}. \]
</p>
<p>
Congestion is a state where $V < m$ and $E = 0$. [somehow need to adjust
assumptions to indicate that it cannot happen during slow flow times - actually 
already taken care of by the assumption of the same distance].
</p>
<p>
How can we determine if an observation (a pair of $F$ and $O$) is in the
congestion state or not? First, in the $F$ vs $O$ plot we can divide them
by taking a derivative of a loess curve and finding a maximum. That
would make the occupancy a sole predictor of the congestion (which might be
reasonable judging from the first plot). However,
as the formula above would indicate, $O$ depends on both $V$ (and
therefore $F$) and $E$, and therefore can have the same value in both
congestion and non-congestion. Also, more importantly, as it is
usually the case, as the flow increases and congestion starts, cars
might not observe a minimal distance rule and move closer to each
other. That might lead to some "transitional" states that are not as
easy to define. Finally, since the data is a time series, time aspect can provide a
valuable information in regards to the question. Therefore methods
such as HMM (Hidden Markov Models) or some supervised clustering might
be better in predicting a state.
</p>
<p>
Static plot here of $O$ vs $V$ (what's up with the quality??? may have to do shiny). 
Point out two clear clusters (possibly a
transitional area); also note spreads in three lanes and, more
importantly, hights of occupancy in traffic and also just before
(indicating distance - space between cars and possibly bigger cars
such as trucks). 
</p>

<p>
We can see clear distinction between the lanes here. Let's look into that more closely.
</p>

<div class="header">
  <h2>Lane Comparison</h2>
</div>

<p>
It would be interesting to compare the lanes in terms of
</p>
<ul>
  <li>speed</li>
  <li>distance between cars</li>
  <li>behavior around rush hours</li>
</ul>
<p>
Histogram of speeds in three lanes + boxplot (static plot)
</p>

<div class="chunk" id="unnamed-chunk-3"><div class="rimage default"><img src="figure/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-3" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-3" class="plot" /></div></div>

<p>
We can see that speed in the right lane is lower in general and has
much greater spread. However, it doesn't mean that the cars in the
right lane are always slower. Also, there is no clear bimodality in the right
lane unlike the other two lanes.
</p>
<p>
Let's look at the time series again,
this time including the speed and indicating congestion (plot,
interactive, preferrably where you can pick time of day and day of
week). Middle lane is the fasterst in general (fast drivers avoid left
lane to not get caught), and the leftmost lane
is the least variable (people don't drive slowly there even at night).

<p>
What we can see:
</p>

<div class="header">
  <h2>Conclusions</h2>
</div>  

<ol>
  <li>Flow/occ in left higher (probably at the same speed) - less
  distance between cars and/or longer cars (cars in the right lane,
  rarely in the left) </li>
  <li>At nights variable speeds in right lane (when the flow is
  low)</li>
  <li> Left lane - don't go slowly in general</li>
  <li> Middle lane is fastest during daytime
  <li> During higher flow - speed similar in all lanes</li>
  <li> Congestion starts in left lane, then middle, then right</li>
  <li> Maximal flow before congestion starts</li>
  <li> Occupancy - the best predictor of congestion</li>
  <li> Flow lower after congestion than before</li>
  <li> During congestion - right lane slower (not necessarily - could
  be distance)? same speed higher occupancy means less distance (is
  distance head-to-head or head-to-tail?) and/or trucks</li>
  <li> Might want to identify transitional state - very beginning of
  congestion what happens at that moment - cars reduce distance while
  trying to keep the speed (violate our assumption of c = 2 seconds
  rule) </li>
  <li> Also note that "c" (the rule) is different in each lane </li>
  <li> On Sunday - probably congestion due to something, not high
  flow</li>
  <li> The reason why we can't just use occupancy is not because of V
  and E combination, but because of shrinking "c" just before
  congestion But can still break them up by taking derivative of a
  loess line </li>
</ol>
