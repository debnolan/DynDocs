 <h1>Traffic on I-80: Congestion and Line Comparison</h1> 
 <h2>Exploratory Data Analysis</h2>
<!-- <h2>Introduction</h2> -->
</div>
  
<p>
PeMS is a California freeway performance measurement system that has
real time and archived data collected from over 25,000 inductive-loop
traffic detectors across the state. It receives flow and occupancy
measurements every 30 seconds, 2 GB of data per day. Flow is the
number of cars passing over a detector in a time interval, and
occupancy is the percentage of time there was a car over the loop.
</p>

<p>
We will look at the data from one particular location on eastbound
I-80 in Sacramento from March 14 - 20, 2003, recorded in successive five
minute intervals, 1740 intervals in all. For each of the three lanes,
there are flow and occupancy measurements. 
</p>
<p>
Our goals are to look at the congestions on a freeway and explore the
differences between the lanes of traffic.
</p> 

<div class="header">
  <h3>Flow and Occupancy</h3>
</div>  

<p>
Look at the Flow and Occupancy time series: can you guess times of the
day? Days of the week? 
</p>

<div class="container-fluid">

<p>
What is the relationship between $F$ (flow) and $O$ (occupancy)? 
</p>

<div class="col" align="center">    
  <div id="plot2" class="shiny-plot-output" align="center"
    style="width: 80%; height: 450px">
  </div>
</div>  

<p>
We can see that overall the relationship is not linear, but there is
clearly a pattern. While it does not seem reasonable to try to fit a
regression line to the whole data, we can use local weighted
polynomial smoother - loess (fit one line to 
each of the lanes). Most of the points are concentrated on the left
side of the graph, where the relationship certainly seems linear;
let's assume it's non-congested traffic. This makes sense since the
ratio of $F$ to $O$ is a quantity directly related to speed.
</p>

  <div class="checkbox">
    <label>
      <input id="loess" type="checkbox"/>
      <span>Fit loess lines to the data in the plot above</span>
    </label>
  </div>  

<div class="header">
  <h3>Speed, Distance, and Congestion</h3>
</div>  

<p>
If the length of the cars is the same for all the cars, $F/O$ is proportional to
the speed. For simplicity, let's make a few assumptions that will help
us formalize the relationships between the variables (we can relax those
assumptions later) and make a clear definition of congestion:
</p>
<ol>
  <li> $l$ - length of the car (constant)</li>
  <li> All the cars follow a "two-second rule" or "$c$-second rule" ($c$
  might be different for each lane): a driver has to reach a point on
  the road at least $c$ seconds after the car directly in front passed
  it. $c$ is a constant.</li>
  <li> If a car's speed is limited by the car in front of it, it keeps
  the minimal distance required by a "$c$-second rule".</li>
  <li> Speed is constant during each five-minute interval (can think
  of average speed).</li>
  <li> Distances between the cars are the same during each five-minute interval 
  (can think of average distance).</li>
  <li> All cars observe some speed limit $m$ (can be different for
  each lane).</li>
</ol>
<p>
Some more useful notation:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>$V = \displaystyle{\frac{F}{O} \propto Speed}$ 
  (will call $V$ speed for short  )</li>
  <li>$D$ - space between the cars (rear bumper to front bumper)</li>
  <li>$E$ - extra space between the cars (in addition to the space
  required by a "$c$-second rule"</li>
</ul>
<p>
Then 
\[ O = \frac{l}{l + D} = \frac{l}{l + cV + E} = \frac{l - cF}{l + E}. \]
</p>
<p>
Congestion is a state where $V < m$ and $E = 0$. 
</p>
<p>
How can we determine if an observation (a pair of $F$ and $O$) is in the
congestion state or not? First, in the $F$ vs $O$ plot above we can
separate observations
by taking a derivative of a loess curve and finding a maximum. That
would make the occupancy a sole predictor of the congestion (which might be
reasonable judging from the first plot). However,
as the formula above would indicate, $O$ depends on both $V$ (and
therefore $F$) and $E$, and therefore can have the same value in both
congestion and non-congestion. Also, more importantly, as it is
usually the case, as the flow increases and congestion starts, cars
might not observe a minimal distance rule and move closer to each
other. That might lead to some "transitional" states that are not as
easy to define. Finally, since the data is a time series, time aspect can provide a
valuable information in regards to the question. Therefore methods
such as HMM (Hidden Markov Models) or some supervised clustering might
be better in predicting a state.
</p>
<p>
From the $F$ vs $O$ plot we can also see clear distinction between the
lanes. Let's look into that more closely. 
</p>

<div class="header">
  <h3>Lane Comparison</h3>
</div>

<p>
It would be interesting to compare the lanes in terms of
</p>
<ul>
  <li>speed</li>
  <li>distance between cars</li>
  <li>behavior around rush hours</li>
</ul>
<p>
Speed in three lanes - distribution comparison:
</p>

<p class="centeredImage">
  <img src="figure/speedHist.png" style="width: 72%; height: 500px" />
</p>

<p>
We can see that speed in the right lane is slower in general and has
much greater spread. However, it doesn't mean that the cars in the
right lane are always slower. Also, there is no clear bimodality in
the right lane unlike the other two lanes. Middle lane is the fasterst
in general (possible reason - fast drivers avoid left lane to not get
caught), and the leftmost lane is the least variable (people don't
drive slowly there even at night). 
</p>
<p>
Looking at the time series again, this time including the speed and
possibly indicating congestion states, will
help us understand what is happening in more detail.
</p>
<p>
Below is a plot of Occupancy vs Speed. Two distinctive clusters can be
seen, probably corresponding to the states of congestion and
non-congestion. Points between them might correspond to a
"transitional" state - when the flow starts exceeding lane capacity
and congestion begins. To divide the states, draw a line on the graph
by double clicking on two locations inside the plot. The time series plot
below it will reflect the assignment of congestion states. To look at individual
points, single click on them and they will appear in the time series
as well (green-colored). To clear all the points and division of
states, click the buttons below the plot. Time series can be
zoomed in by selecting a time period for the zoom.
</p>
<p>
Note: "quadratic curve" pattern for low occupancy in $O$ vs $V$ plot is due
to extreme discreteness of flow measurements during low flow times
(mostly at night). 
</p>

<!-- and the following time series plot -->

  data-brush-reset-on-new="TRUE">
</div>

<div id="plot5" class="shiny-plot-output" 
  style="width: 100%; height: 500px"></div> 

<p>
In these plots, differences in spreads of speed distributions are
noticeable as well. Another interesting observation is that $O$ in
congestion state is the highest for the left lane and the lowest for
the right for the same $V$. Similar difference between the lanes can
be seen in the $F$ 
vs $O$ graph (higher $F$ in the left lane for the same $O$). To make
sense of it, we relax the assumption of cars observing the distance to
the vehicle in front. The fact that the highest flow right before
congestion occurs in the left lane might indicate that cars in the
left lane get closer to each other. The other reason could be that
vehicles differ in length, with composition of types of vehicles
varying by lane (e.g. greater number of trucks in the
rightmost lane, especially at night), which would affect calculation
of speed. 
</p>

<div class="header">
  <h3>Conclusions</h3>
</div>  

<p>
To collect and summarize our observations:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Higher flow in the left lane during/right before congestion
  might suggest less distance between cars and/or shorter vehicles
  (trucks usually in the right lane, rarely in the left); </li>
  <li>At nights variable speeds in the right lane (when the flow is
  low), longer vehicles possibly a factor as well;</li>
  <li> During higher flow - speed somewhat similar in all lanes;</li>
  <li> Left lane - cars don't go slowly in general;</li>
  <li> Middle lane is fastest during daytime;</li>
  <li> Congestion starts in left lane, then middle, then right;</li>
  <li> Maximal flow can be observed right before congestion starts;</li>
  <li> Occupancy - the best predictor of congestion;</li>
  <li> Flow lower after congestion than before;</li>
  <li> Might be reasonable to identify transitional state - the very beginning of
  congestion when cars reduce distance while trying to keep the speed; </li>
  <li> Also note that $c$ (for the $c$-rule) is different in each lane; </li>
  <li> Congestion on Sunday is probably due to some road conditions,
  not resulting from high flow.</li>
</ol>
